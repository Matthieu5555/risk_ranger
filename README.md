# RiskRanger

#### Description:
RiskRanger is a Python program designed to analyze stock trading volumes and calculate various risk metrics using data from Yahoo Finance. Users can input stock tickers, define a historical period for analysis, and receive detailed risk assessments including VaR, CVaR, and Sharpe ratios. The program also calculates additional statistics such as total returns, annualized returns, volatility, and maximum drawdown.

#### Files:
The program runs independantly

#### Process:
The development of RiskRanger was inspired by the Edhec's Python for Finance Mooc. The initial version was a simple program leveraging the yfinance library to apply fundamental principles from the course. The primary challenge that I encountered later, was incorporating a reliable risk-free rate approximation for the Sharpe ratio calculation, which added complexity and accuracy to the analysis.

#### To do:
Quite happy with it, not gun lie.
